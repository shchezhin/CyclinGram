# CyclinGram
My small app to analyze cycling stats from Strava API and to visualize them into an image.

The user logs in with his Strava account. The app gets his cycling statistics via API and calculates a couple of text statements.
Then the user picks a photo from his device's gallery, the app overlays a statement on the image and then the picture is saved to the device.
